# React Project Starter

This starter project has everything you need to start writing React as fast as possible. 

No need for configuration, works out of the box by installing dependencies and starting the development server with `npm start`.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
